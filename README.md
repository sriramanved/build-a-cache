# Build-a-Cache
For the final project in Computer Organization and Systems Programming class at Cornell, CS 3410, I created a performance simulator: a C program that simulates the behavior of a cache. My cache simulator takes as input a memory trace: a list of load and store instructions that were executed during a single run of a single program.

I used a single-core memory trace to evaluate the impact of cache size, associativity, block size, etc. on cache performance. After extending my simulator to model multiple caches, I used a 4-core memory trace to evaluate the impact of different cache coherence protocols, such as VI, MSI, MESI, etc. I was then asked to run a series of experiments with my cache simulator, from which I made a report of the experiments with an analysis of cache performance using graphical visualizations.
